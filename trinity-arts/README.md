aRts sound system

aRts is a short form for "analog realtime synthesizer". aRts is highly
modular, creating and processing sound using small modules performing
specific tasks. These may create a waveform (oscillators), play samples,
filter data, add signals, perform effects like delay/flanger/chorus, or
output the data to the soundcard.

All of the aRts documentation is now in "The aRts Handbook" which is
in TDE DocBook format, part of tdemultimedia. It should be found on a
KDE system in $TDEDIR/share/doc/tde/HTML/default/artsbuilder/index.html.
